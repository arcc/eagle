CARA Eagle Files
================

This repository is home to the Center of Advanced Radio Astronomy's Cadsoft
Eagle support files. 

[Cadsoft Eagle][eagle] is a circuit and pcb design software used for
electronics design within CARA. CARA has standardized on Eagle major version 6,
so all libraries contained within are not compatible with Eagle 5 or older. At
the time of writing (7/2013), the libraries are Eagle 6.4 compatible.


## Installation ##

### Linux/OSX ###


Clone the git repo to your system. For this guide, I will assume it is cloned to
`~/caraeagle`

    git clone git@github.com:arcc/eagle ~/caraeagle

Then add the libraries to Eagle:

1. Launch Eagle
2. On the Eagle Control Pannel, go to Options > Directories
3. Add `$HOME/.caraeagle/XXX:`, where XXX is one of the following
    * lbr
    * dru
    * ulp
    * scr
    * cam
